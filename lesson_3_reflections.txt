When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	Using a remote repository gives to the user the chance to share his work with other people. besides, it's the best to start collaborate with other to the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	It's necessary to pull changes manually to your repository, so that, only when your local files are ready for the public, they can be committed and pulled on a remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forking gives to the user the chance to clone on GitHub server a repository of another user and make changes to it. In this way you can do changes on a repository that doesn't belong to you (or that you aren't authorized to change) and share it with other collaborators.
	Cloning is used locally or from GitHub to a local destination to "clone" a repository.
	A branch is used, on the other side, to make experimental changes to a repo that need to be tested before become a part of the public and official repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	In this way you can do locally changes when you're offline and go on merging remote changes when you come back online.
	This helps, besides, when collaborating with others to the same project, and you have to compare the last known state of the remote with your local changes.
