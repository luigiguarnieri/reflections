When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	Using a remote repository gives to the user the chance to share his work with other people. besides, it's the best to start collaborate with other to the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	It's necessary to pull changes manually to your repository, so that, only when your local files are ready for the public, they can be committed and pulled on a remote repository.
