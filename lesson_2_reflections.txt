What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	I guess that git tells me what files are contained inside the repository and then its necessary to let git start tracking those files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area is a place where you can put files maintained under version control through a git repository. It can be an entire working directory, or it can be made only by one or more files contained in that directory.
